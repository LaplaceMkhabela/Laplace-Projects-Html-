    Song Lyrics
    </h1><hr>
        [Intro]
        Awwwww...haha

        [Verse 1]
        Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
        Screamin' "Dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
        And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
        Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
        Nigga, I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
        Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
        Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
        Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
        God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
        Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
        And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
        Summer Rain come again
        Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
        In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
        Eyes wellin' up with tears
        Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
        Immortalized on this shirt

        [Chorus]
        Real niggas don't die
        Forward with the plot
        One-Seven-Forty-Five
        Form at the plot
        Real niggas don't die
        Form on the block
        Real niggas don't lie
        Form in the plot
        My niggas don't die
        Form on the block
        Real niggas don't die
        Form on the block
        Real niggas don't die
        Real niggas don't die

        [Verse 2]
        Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
        Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
        Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
        Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
        Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M, nigga, that green
        I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
        And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
        I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
        Kingpin, nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
        If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
        And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
        A legend, what that mean?

        [Chorus]
        Real niggas don't die
        Forward with the plot
        One-Seven-Forty-Five
        Form at the plot
        Real niggas don't die
        Form on the block
        Hood niggas don't lie
        Form in the plot
        My niggas don't die
        Form on the block
        Real niggas don't die
        Form on the block
        Real niggas don't die
        Real niggas don't die

        [Verse 3]
        To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
        'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
        'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
        And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
        Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
        My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
        I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
        And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
        They tellin' niggas, "Sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
        In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
        That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
        The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen
    </pre>
